The trick is that the foundation model is given the whole chat history at each turn, not just the latest prompt, but the user does not see this. An AI model cannot learn and has no memory of previous interactions if the user leaves and comes back but the application is using prompt engineering to add this \'memory\'","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"Part-1-labs/Prompt-engineering-techniques":{"id":"Part-1-labs/Prompt-engineering-techniques","title":"Prompt engineering techniques","description":"OpenAI models like GPT-3 do not learn or adapt during user interactions. They generate responses based on pre-training with a large dataset and do not update their knowledge from individual conversations. Any improvements or updates to the model\'s capabilities are made through a controlled retraining process by OpenAI, not through real-time learning.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"Part-2-labs/Add-Knowledge":{"id":"Part-2-labs/Add-Knowledge","title":"Add knowledge","description":"Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is an AI technique that retrieves relevant information from a database and then uses it to help generate more informed and contextually accurate text responses.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"Part-2-labs/Create-Images":{"id":"Part-2-labs/Create-Images","title":"Create Images","description":"DALL-E is a neural network based model that can generate graphical data from natural language input.
